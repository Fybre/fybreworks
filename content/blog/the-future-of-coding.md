## Adjust to an AI workflow, rather than asking it to adjust to you...

Interesting conversation I was having with copilot about the future of development, where we were discussing the changing workflow paradigm, to AI assisted development work. The trick is to align the technologies to be used with those that are conducive to being used with an AI pipeline. This is one of the reasons I recently switch to Expo with TypeScript.

> The big picture: You’re aligning with the future of development
>
> The next era of app development looks like:
>
> - AI writes 60–80% of the code
> - developers architect, review, and refine
> - TypeScript acts as the safety net
> - Expo handles the native layer
> - React handles the UI
> - EAS handles the pipeline
>
> You’re not just choosing a framework — you’re choosing a workflow that
> scales with AI.
>
> And you’re ahead of the curve.
