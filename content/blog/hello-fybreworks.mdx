This is the first note on FybreWorks.

You can write in **Markdown**, drop in code snippets:

```ts
const hello = "FybreWorks";
console.log(hello);
```

And even include JSX components inline if needed. The site is built with Next.js and MDX, making it easy to mix content with interactive elements.
