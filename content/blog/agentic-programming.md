## So, me and my buddy Claude

Well, I've recently fallen into that rabbit hole of agentic programming. I have to admit, it's really addictive. A project that would have taken me weeks previously
is now done in a matter of days, or even hours.
I had to implement HMAC SHA256 in jscript (I mean, it's Microsoft's version of Javascript so who expects much?!) and Claude wrote it for me in minutes. I am both
impressed, and really jealous.
Which brings me to the topic, I've never quite felt so invigorated with the opportunities made available with Agentic AI, but also fallen into the trap of a lack of
investment in my product... it tends to also encourage apathy or a sense of disconnect. After all, it's really hard to feel a sense of ownership when you weren't really 
the one pouring your brain into the code.
