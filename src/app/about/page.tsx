        Fybre - the gamertag, FybreWorks - my work. This site is my personal
        corner of the internet for collecting thoughts, documenting experiments,
        and sharing the software I build along the way.

        I'm a developer and consultant passionate about creating clean user
        experiences, building reliable workflows, and developing tools that
        empower rather than complicate. Ethics guide both my business decisions
        and personal conduct, and I strive to reflect these values in every
        project I undertake.

      <p className="text-slate-300 animate-fade-in-up stagger-3">
        This site embraces intentional minimalism, allowing the content to take
        center stage without unnecessary distractions. Also because I suck at
        design.
